# ngff-roadmap-draft
Example of using the new projects as a roadmap for NGFF development.

The current roadmap project is available at https://github.com/ome/ngff/projects/1 using the traditional GH project layout. For a few months, there has been a new style of project more like a spreadsheet (See https://docs.github.com/en/issues/trying-out-the-new-projects-experience/about-projects for more information). In this repository, I've created new issues for possible upcoming milestones in order to discuss the content, the prioritization, and the layout of the roadmap. Once we are happy with all the above, the issues can all be transferred to https://github.com/ome/ngff/.

## The new Roadmap Project

https://github.com/users/joshmoore/projects/3/views/1 is an example of the new Project layout.

### Pros
* Public location that doesn't require updating websites, etc.
* Hopefully keeps roadmap up-to-date as issues are closed, etc.
* Allows ordering of items and extra fields for filtering, etc.

### Cons
* Doesn't have a git history of changes (must check the issues themselves)
* Doesn't easily embed in another webpage (like a markdown file)
